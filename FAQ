<h3>Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)</h3>
<ol>
<li><strong>What is Creative Commons?</strong></li>
<p>Creative Commons (CC) is a global nonprofit organization that enables sharing and reuse of creativity and knowledge through the provision of free legal tools. Our legal tools help those who want to encourage reuse of their works by offering them for use under generous, standardized terms, those who want to make creative uses of works, and those who want to benefit from this symbiosis.</p>
<li><strong>Is CC against copyright?</strong></li>
<p>Absolutely not. Creative Commons licenses are copyright licenses, and depend on the existence of copyright to work. CC licenses simply help creators extend reuse and remixing rights of their creative work to the public.</p>
<li><strong>What do CC licenses allow you to do?</strong></li>
<p>Creative Commons licenses are legal tools that creators and other rightsholders can use to offer certain usage rights to the public, while reserving other rights. The six Creative Commons licenses provide a simple vocabulary for what would otherwise be a complicated agreement between creator and licensee. By selecting a license, copyright holders choose which rights they’d like to keep and what types of reuse to allow.</p>
<li><strong>What reuse/remix rights am I giving to the public by putting a CC license on my work?</strong></li>
<p>At a minimum, all CC license allow users to download and share your work with others. They must also always credit you credit through attribution (BY) when they do so. You can choose what other limits you want to place on sharing. CC licenses make it easy to retain the rights to make commercial use of your work (NC), make derivative works from your work (ND), or to require future remixes to carry the same license (SA).</p>
<li><strong>How much does a CC license cost, and how do I get one?</strong></li>
<p>Creative Commons licenses are free of charge (gratis) for anyone to use. CC doesn’t require or provide registration for creators who use CC them. CC licenses can be applied to many types of creative work; Websites, videos, audio/music files, images, documents, and more can all be CC-licensed. Head over to the license chooser on the CC website (creativecommons.org/choose) or the marking section of the CC wiki (wiki.creativecommons.org/marking) for more information.</p>
<li><strong>Where can I find material offered under a CC license?</strong></li>
<p>Hundreds of millions of works have been released under a Creative Commons license, and many of them can be found by using search engines or browsing content platforms. CC Search (search.creativecommons.org) is also a good starting point when looking for CC-licensed work.
